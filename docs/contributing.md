## Adding Languages
If you're not familiar with the typical GitHub (fork-edit-PR) workflow, please read the [GitHub
guide](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/) on the matter.

1. Create a [Docker image](https://hub.docker.com) with the toolchain for the language, and submit it to the
   [languages](https://github.com/attempt-this-online/languages) repository, based on our common base image
   `registry.gitlab.pxeger.com/attempt-this-online/attempt-this-online/base` (which uses Arch Linux)
   - in rare cases (such as for non-open-source languages), an existing Docker image that isn't based on
     `registry.gitlab.pxeger.com/attempt-this-online/attempt-this-online/base` may be used
   - for languages that require other languages, base the new language on another ATO image for the required
     language. For example, Jelly's interpreter is written in Python, so Jelly's image is based on
     `registry.gitlab.pxeger.com/attempt-this-online/attempt-this-online/python`
   - the build process of the Docker image should follow the general pattern of:
     - declare a Docker build argument corresponding to the language's version; this can be used as an evironment
       variable throughout the Dockerfile thereafter. This allows fast updating of the Docker images
     - install any dependencies necessary to compile the language from source
     - download and extract the source code of the language
     - compile the language's source code
     - install the compiled language (if just a few binaries are provided, they should go in `/usr/local/bin/`; if the
       installation is more complex, put it into a directory in `/opt/`)
     - clean up any downloaded or cached files that are no longer needed
   - a fairly easy-to-follow example of this is [Zsh](https://github.com/attempt-this-online/languages/blob/main/languages/zsh/Dockerfile)
   - if the language is particularly complex (or just slow) to build from source, a pre-built version can be used
     (example: [Java](https://github.com/attempt-this-online/languages/blob/main/languages/java/Dockerfile))
   - make a pull request to add it to the repository (from where it will be built and pushed to my GitLab registry automatically)
2. Add the language's metadata to `languages.json`; set the *key* to an identifier-safe name for the
   language (avoid special characters); in the value, set these fields:
   - name (should be human-readable - this is what will be presented to the user in the UI)
   - image (name of the Docker image used to run the code)
       - this must be normalised, to include both the Docker Registry URL, and the tag
   - version (set this to whatever boundary we guarantee to the user, not just the version it currently uses)
   - URL (homepage of the language)
   - SBCS (set to `true` if the language's code uses a single-byte character set; this will change the behaviour of the
     byte counter in the frontend to assume all characters comprise one byte (rather than using UTF-8))
   - `se_class` (provide this only if StackExchange has built-in syntax highlighting for the language; this will be added
     when a CGCC post template is generated. See [here](https://meta.stackexchange.com/q/184108) for details)
   - `hello_world`: an object containing a description of a simple "hello world"-type program in the language. It has
     attributes:
     - `code` (string, required)
     - `input` (string, optional, defaults to empty)
     - `options` and `arguments` (list of strings, defaulting to empty)
     - `output` (string, required) - the expected stdout of the program (stderr is ignored)
     - If your language cannot produce a simple hello world program fitting these criteria, write a comment on #127, and
       leave this field undefined for now
3. Create a runner script in `runners/`, named the same as the key in `languages.json`. Here is an example showing the
   general idea:

```sh
#!/bin/sh
# There are no minimal requirements for the Docker image, as long as it doesn't contain a /ATO directory. If the Docker
# image you're using doesn't have a POSIX shell, it is always available as `/ATO/bash`. If you need to use it, make sure
# to change the `#!` (shebang) line above to match that.

# Do whatever is necessary to compile and run the code.
# - code is saved in /ATO/code
# - input provided by the user is saved in /ATO/input
# - options to pass to the compiler or interpreter are stored in /ATO/options, null-terminated
# - options to pass to the program itself are stored in /ATO/arguments

# Use /ATO/yargs to substitute in the command-line options: the first argument is the replacement string, the second is
# the intput file for the arguments, and after is the program and its arguments. The replacement string indicates the
# position of the substitution.
/ATO/yargs % /ATO/options gcc % /ATO/code -o /ATO/compiled

# Note that, while the script will always start in /ATO/, you should always use absolute paths.

# The code itself should always be run in the working directory /ATO/context
cd /ATO/context

# Pass arguments to the compiled file. Also, make sure you give the program input from /ATO/input.
/ATO/yargs % /ATO/arguments /ATO/compiled % < /ATO/input

# Make sure you retain the status code of the program! If you need to do any cleanup for whatever reason, make sure to
# store a copy of the exit code and use it again.
stored_status="$?"
do_cleanup
exit "$stored_status"
```

Here is another example runner for an interpreted language instead:

```sh
#!/bin/sh

cd /ATO/context

# Use two levels of yargs to substitute in multiple sets of arguments:
/ATO/yargs %1 /ATO/options /ATO/yargs %2 /ATO/arguments python %1 /ATO/code %2 < /ATO/input
```
  - Make sure you've made the runner script executable (`chmod +x runners/path`)
  - Test your runner! It's unhelpful if you submit a broken runner
  - Make a [Pull Request](https://github.com/attempt-this-online/attempt-this-online/pulls) to add the runner for

## Making Releases
- Update version numbers in `frontend/package.json`, `Cargo.toml`, and `setup/setup`
- Upgrade dependencies (`cd frontend; npm update; cd ..; cargo update`)
- Stage and commit changes
- Tag version in git, e.g. `v0.1.2`
- Push `main` **and the new tag** to GitHub
- Build package `./build`
- Upload `setup/setup` and `dist/attempt_this_online.tar.gz` to GitHub release
- Set description etc. on GitHub release

## Backend developer instructions
The backend is written in Rust. You'll need the nightly Rust compiler and cargo.

- `src/main.rs` is the main entrypoint to the service and contains the websocket server handling code
- `src/sandbox.rs` contains the core sandbox and execution wrapper

See [Architecture](./architecture.md) for more details on how the overall system works.

A development environment is provided using Docker, with the `docker-compose.yml` file.
You'll still do all your development outside the container, but the server itself will run in one.

You'll need [Docker](https://docs.docker.com) and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/). If using Docker
Engine, your OS must also support unprivileged user namespaces and cgroup v2 (what systemd calls the "unified cgroup
hierarchy").

To build the code, run:

```bash
cargo build
```

Then to run the Docker container:

```
sudo docker-compose up
```

This will automatically restart each time you rebuild it. The API will then be available on `127.0.0.1:8500`.

> [!CAUTION]
> The docker-compose file is **not secure**. It's fine for development if you don't expose the server to the network,
> but it shouldn't be used in production.

> [!NOTE]
> To save disk space and setup time, the docker-compose file only sets up one language, zsh.
> All other languages will fail.

### Tests
There are some basic tests written in Python (make sure you have version 3.10 or higher installed). These can test both
the sandbox's functionality, and all the languages.

The `test/run` helper script will set up the testing environment for you if needed (as well as running the tests).
Pass it the URL to the API, like this:

```bash
URL='ws://localhost:8500/api/v1/ws/execute' test/run
```

To skip the tests which require all languages' images to be installed, set the `FAST` environment variable to 1.

```bash
FAST=1 URL='...' test/run
```

Some of the tests still take a few seconds to run (because they test timing things). To skip these too, set `FAST` to 2.

In addition, some of the tests don't make sense if ATO is running on a remote server (different to the one the test are
running on), as they check things like the timing or the state of the operating system after calling ATO. These can be
skipped by setting the `REMOTE` environment variable:

```bash
REMOTE=1 URL='...' test/run
```

**TODO**: separate timing-based tests (which only fail over slow network connections) from OS-state-based tests (which also fail when ATO runs in a virtual machine, e.g. with Docker Desktop)

### Automatic rebuilds
You may find it useful to have your code automatically rebuilt. Install [`entr`](https://eradman.com/entrproject/),
then run, in different shell instances:

```bash
ls src | entr -c cargo build --all-targets
```

With the Docker Compose setup provided, the server will restart automatically when it is rebuilt.

To rerun tests automatically as well:

```bash
export URL='ws://localhost:8500/api/v1/ws/execute'
# export FAST=1
ls target/debug/attempt-this-online test/test.py | entr -c test/run
```
